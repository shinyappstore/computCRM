# computCRM: Continuous Reassessment Method


#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/computCRM](https://shinyappstore.com/a/computCRM)__

computCRM is a dedicated application designed for the analysis employing the Continuous Reassessment Method (CRM) in statistical studies. The Continuous Reassessment Method is a statistical technique commonly applied in phase I clinical trials. For instance, in oncology research, CRM dynamically adjusts dose levels based on observed toxicities to efficiently identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of a novel treatment. Characterized by simplicity with limited functionality, computCRM offers a user-friendly experience. It comes with a built-in dataset, though currently, users are unable to upload their datasets. Designed primarily for exploratory purposes, computCRM allows users to monitor the effects of various changes in the statistical model, providing valuable insights into the dose-finding process in early-phase clinical trials.
